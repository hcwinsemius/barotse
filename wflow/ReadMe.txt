This model was automatically set up using a combination of different Python scripts and data sources. 

Several folders and files have been updated, including 'intbl', 'staticmaps' and the model .ini file. 
This means that other folders and files, specifically those in the 'data\parameters' folder, might contain outdated information. 

Setup and debug information is stored in the 'setup' folder. This contains, amongst others:
- log file, with the following levels:
  - INFO:     information deemed relevant during and/or after execution of setup
  - WARNING:  potential issue was encountered for which a workaround was in place, should probably be checked
  - ERROR:    potential issue was encountered for which no workaround was in place, should definitely be checked
  - CRITICAL: could not execute code that is vital for success, no setup/processing could be carried out
- ini file
- settings file
- used scripts
- figures related to the set up of lakes and/or reservoir intbl's and the Annual Discharge parameter
